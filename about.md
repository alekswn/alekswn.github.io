My name is Alexey aka Alekswn. I was born in the heart of Russia but I'm living in Chile at the moment.

I'm a software engineer specialized in the field of system and application development for handheld and embedded
devices. My favorite language is C++1x however I feel myself comfortable using Java for native Android app's and plain C
for kernel drivers.

My academic background is related to digital signal processing and space satellite technologies including imaging,
remote seeing and navigation. 

I keen on image and video processing. 

### What am I looking for ?

I'm looking for a job (preferably remote) of a senior software engineer at a small start-up company or for partners to
found an e-learning start-up [Pocket.School](http://habla.re).

### Feel free to contact me.
