Who am I?

Iâ€™m a back-end software engineer and I love to write beautiful performance critical code in C++14 and do lighting-fast prototyping in Python 3. Also, I have experience in low-level and embedded programming. 

I'm keen on image and video processing algorithms.

My academic background is related to digital signal processing and space satellite technologies including imaging, remote seeing, and navigation.
