My name is Alexey, AKA AleksWN. 

I'm a software engineer specialized in the field of system and application development for handheld and embedded
devices. My favorite language is C++1x however I feel comfortable using Java for native Android app's and plain C
for kernel drivers.

My academic background is related to digital signal processing and space satellite technologies including imaging,
remote seeing and navigation. 

I am keen on image and video processing. 

### What am I looking for ?

I'm looking for a job (preferably remote) of a senior software engineer at a small start-up company.
